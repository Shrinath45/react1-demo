                    Event Binding in React


1. What is Event?

- Event is a message sent by sender to its subscriber in order to notify changes.
- Event uses "Delegate" mechanism. [function pointer]
- Event follows "Observer" pattern.
- JavaScript events are derived from "Browser Window" object.
- React can't use JavaScript Browser events.
- React library provides "SyntheticEvents" base class, which provides access to all events in virtual DOM.


2. What are SyntheticEvents?

- Synthetic Events are virtual DOM events that map to actual DOM.
- It is base for all events in React.

    React => onClick => Browser => onClick


3. Synthetic Event Types

    - MouseEvents
    - KeyboardEvents
    - ButtonEvents
    - TimerEvents
    - TouchEvents
    - FormEvents
    - Element State Events
    - Clipboard Events
        etc...

Note: React can manage two-way data binding only with "onChange" event.

4. Event Handler

- It configures event and function for element.

    <button onClick={handleClick}> Submit </button>

- Event handler in React provides "event" argument as default argument, which contains information about event and element.

    event.clientX
    event.clientY
    event.keyCode
    event.altKey
    event.which
    event.target.index
    event.target.value
    event.target.className

    Syntax:
            <button id="btnInsert" value="Insert" className="btn btn-primary" onClick={InsertClick}>
                Insert
            </button>


        function InsertClick(){
            e.target.id,
            e.target.value,
            e.target.className,
            e.clientX,
            e.clientY,
            e.altKey,
            e.keyCode etc
        }

5. Custom Arguments in React Events

- Synthetic Event handler provides only default event arguments implicitly.
- To configure custom arguments you have to return a function on specific event.

    Syntax:
            <button onClick={ (e)=> InsertClick(e, 'str', 10, true)}>Click Me</button>

            function InsertClick(e, msg, num, bool){
                
            }
